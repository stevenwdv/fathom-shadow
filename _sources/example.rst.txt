Example Ruleset
===============

This is the simple example ruleset that ships with FathomFox; it is made available for experimentation when you run :doc:`commands/fox` without passing in your own ruleset. In its comments, it documents the structure of the ``trainees`` object, which is what :doc:`the trainer<commands/train>` needs to do its job.
