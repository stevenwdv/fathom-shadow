 * vertical falloffs and flat horizontal regions, where continuous numerical
 * optimization methods get stuck. It starts off looking far afield for global
 * minima and gradually shifts its focus to the best local one as time
 * progresses.
 *
 * More technically, we look around at random for changes that reduce the value
 * of the cost function. Occasionally, a random change that increases cost is
 * incorporated. The chance of incorporating a cost-increasing change lessens
 * as the algorithim progresses.
